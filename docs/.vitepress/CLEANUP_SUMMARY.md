### Unused Component Files
- `docs/zh/curd/components/std-detail.md` → Not referenced in navigation
- `docs/zh/curd/components/std-pagination.md` → Not referenced in navigation

## Redirect Mappings

Added comprehensive redirect mappings in `docs/.vitepress/shared.ts` to handle old URLs:
- All old file paths redirect to their new consolidated locations
- Individual form control files redirect to appropriate consolidated pages
- Old directory structure redirects to new structure

## Impact Summary

### Files Reduced
- **Before**: ~50+ individual documentation files
- **After**: 19 organized documentation files
- **Reduction**: ~60% fewer files to maintain

### Directory Structure Simplified
- **Before**: 4 main directories (advance, core, components, form-controls) + root files
- **After**: 4 main directories (advanced, components, form-controls, fundamentals) + root files
- **Improvement**: Clearer naming and organization

### Navigation Simplified
- **Before**: Complex nested navigation with many individual entries
- **After**: Streamlined navigation with logical groupings
- **Benefit**: Easier to find information, reduced cognitive load

## Verification

- ✅ VitePress build completes successfully
- ✅ No broken internal links detected
- ✅ All redirects configured for old URLs
- ✅ Navigation structure matches new file organization
- ✅ Demo files preserved and functional

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for any external links that might reference old URLs
2. Update any external documentation or tutorials that reference old paths
3. Consider adding a deprecation notice for old URLs after a transition period
